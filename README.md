# Config for the DO52Pro

Based on
[filippor/kb_zmk_ps2_mouse_trackpoint_driver-zmk_config](
https://github.com/filippor/kb_zmk_ps2_mouse_trackpoint_driver-zmk_config) and
[kat1337/zmk-config-do52pro/](https://github.com/kat1337/zmk-config-do52pro/).

The DO52Pro is a cheap kit *with trackpoint!* available from AliExpress, you
can get it for around Â£30, which is an insanely good deal. With the Outemu
half-height Cherry MX stem compatible switches, and some low-profile keycaps (I
have the [XVX skyline keycaps](
https://www.xvxchannel.com/collections/low-profile-keycaps/products/xvx-skyline-137-key-low-profile-double-shot-keycap-set-8-colors),
the keycaps are the same height as the plastics, which is very pleasing.
